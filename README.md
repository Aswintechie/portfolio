## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aswincloud/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployment is fully managed by **Cloudflare Workers Builds** via the connected Git integration:

- **Production** — every push to `main` builds and deploys to [www.aswincloud.com](https://www.aswincloud.com).
- **Previews** — every pull request gets a unique preview URL, posted as a PR comment and torn down on PR close.

Build settings (configured in the Cloudflare dashboard): `npm ci && npm run build` with `./dist` as the assets directory (see [`wrangler.toml`](./wrangler.toml)). Environment variables and secrets (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_ADMIN_CHAT_ID`, `CONTACT_EMAIL`, `FEEDBACK_EMAIL`) are managed in the worker's Settings → Variables panel — production and preview environments can be configured independently.

If you ever need to deploy manually:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

GitHub Actions runs CI only (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint, format check, copyright check, tests, coverage, security audit, build.

## 📧 Email Configuration

The contact form uses MailChannels for sending emails:

- **Notifications**: Sent to `contact@aswincloud.com`
